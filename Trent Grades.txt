
For exercise 3_1, I had to make some fixes. You generally had the right idea, but always check to
make sure that it runs correctly before you submit your work.

3.2: Nice!
3.3: Nice!

4.6: You need to create code body that calls the function. Go ahead and fix but you don't need to
turn it in right now. I'll check again when you turn in work for Chapter 5.

Overall, good work!

4.6 (Revised): Very nice! I like the messages.

5.1: Nice, though "u suck" is a bit harsh! Take a look at the printing embellishments on my code.
5.2: Similar comment here. Nice programming, but "hate" is harsh! Also, look again at printing embellishments.

Quiz 6: 9/10 (You missed one item)

You didn't do exercise 6-5. I'm really wanting you to practice for GSSM. You need to eliminate the bad habit of missing assignments!

Here is the order of the next steps. I'm trying very hard to get into a rhythm, but when you miss things it makes it difficult.

1) I'm going to do a pull request for you to get the above grades and this note.
2) You will add exercise 6-5 and push, then let me know it is ready for grading.
3) I will grade and give you another pull request. I will also push my 5 & 6 for you to grade.
4) You will give me a pull request after you grade my 5 & 6.
5) I will grade 7 and then give you a pull request. I will also push my 7.
6) You will grade 7 and give me a pull request.

All of the above needs to be done before you move onto the assignment for Thursday, which will be Chapter 8. Then we will be back on
track. Please don't miss assignments and throw us off! Thanks! --Your biggest fan

I went ahead and graded 6-5 (nice!) and Chapter 7.

Quiz 7: I score it 9/10. I believe the answer to #9 is try/except, not signal handlers.

7-1 & 7-2: Again, nice, but note in my code the error checking and the flexibility.

OK, we're caught up as soon as you grade mine!

****

Yay! We're caught up! Please be careful about putting everything in the repo before you push it in the future. Thanks!

Quiz #8: 10/10

8-4 & 8-5: These run very nicely and do what they are supposed to do. My only suggestion is that you add two "optional" elements to
your routine. (1) Put a comment at the top to indicate what the code does. Also, when programs get longer, add comments to indicate
what each section of code does. You will see when you program regularly that this becomes hugely important so that you don't have to
figure out what's going on every time you return to it. (2) Add some spacing for various elements to make the code more reasonable.
See my code for an example of this. I know that the code runs without these two features, but if you think of this for the future,
rather than short projects, you'll soon see the benefits.

Nice work!
