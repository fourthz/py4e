For exercise 3_1, I had to make some fixes. You generally had the right idea, but always check to
make sure that it runs correctly before you submit your work.

3.2: Nice!
3.3: Nice!

4.6: You need to create code body that calls the function. Go ahead and fix but you don't need to
turn it in right now. I'll check again when you turn in work for Chapter 5.

Quizzes: I couldn't read these. They were too small and when I zoomed the resolution was bad.
Rather than a picture (which I know is how I first sent to you), notice the way that I'm now sending to you.
This is easier for both the person taking the quiz and for the person grading.

Overall, good work!
